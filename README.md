# Hi, I'm Leo! 👋

I'm a student at Kazan Federal University 🎓, studying at the Department of Applied Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence 🤖. My focus is on **Data Science** 📊, **ML** 🧠, and **CV** 🖼️. I'm eager to enhance my skills in data analysis and the development of AI solutions 💻.

## What I'm studying:
- Machine Learning (ML) 🤖
- Computer Vision and Image Processing 👁️
- Probability Theory and Statistics 📚
- Working with Python 🐍, C/C++ 💻, Bash 🖥️, GitHub 🌐

## Key Projects:
1. **[Gamification Telegram Bot](https://github.com/LeonidMitrofanov/Gamification_tg_bot)**: A Telegram bot 🤖 that implements gamification elements 🎮. Users can complete various tasks ✅ and earn points 🎯, which encourages more active interaction.

## Projects from School21:
1. **[s21_string](https://github.com/LeonidMitrofanov/s21_string)**: Implementation of the standard `string.h` library in C 💡 with additional features ✨. It includes basic string manipulation functions 🔠, as well as partial implementations of `sprintf` and `sscanf`.

2. **[s21_math](https://github.com/LeonidMitrofanov/s21_math)**: Implementation of the standard `math.h` library in C ➗. It includes basic mathematical functions used in computations 🔢.

3. **[s21_decimal](https://github.com/LeonidMitrofanov/s21_decimal)**: Implementation of a library for working with decimal numbers (`decimal`) in C 💰. This data type helps avoid rounding errors 🔄 typical of `float` and is suitable for financial calculations 💵.

## Projects from Kazan Federal University:
1. **[Three-Body Problem](https://github.com/LeonidMitrofanov/Three-Body_Problem)**: A C++ project for solving the three-body problem 🌌 using numerical methods. It implements the Runge-Kutta 4th order method 🧮 to simulate the motion of celestial bodies, such as the Earth 🌍, Moon 🌕, and a small satellite 🛰️. The project supports solving both test ODE systems (e.g., periodic orbits with exact solutions) and complex three-body dynamics (e.g., Arenstorf orbits). Results are saved in .csv files 📊 for easy visualization and analysis.
