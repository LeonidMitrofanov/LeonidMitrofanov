# Hi, I'm Leonid! 👋

I'm a student at Kazan Federal University, studying at the Department of Applied Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence. My focus is on **Data Science**, **ML**, and **CV**. I'm eager to enhance my skills in data analysis and the development of AI solutions.

## What I'm studying:
- Machine Learning (ML)
- Computer Vision and Image Processing
- Probability Theory and Statistics
- Working with Python, C/C++, Bash, GitHub

## Key Projects:
1. **[Gamification Telegram Bot](https://github.com/LeonidMitrofanov/Gamification_tg_bot)**: A Telegram bot that implements gamification elements. Users can complete various tasks and earn points, which encourages more active interaction.

## Projects from School21:
1. **[s21_string](https://github.com/LeonidMitrofanov/s21_string)**: Implementation of the standard `string.h` library in C with additional features. It includes basic string manipulation functions, as well as partial implementations of `sprintf` and `sscanf`.

2. **[s21_math](https://github.com/LeonidMitrofanov/s21_math)**: Implementation of the standard `math.h` library in C. It includes basic mathematical functions used in computations.

3. **[s21_decimal](https://github.com/LeonidMitrofanov/s21_decimal)**: Implementation of a library for working with decimal numbers (`decimal`) in C. This data type helps avoid rounding errors typical of `float` and is suitable for financial calculations.
